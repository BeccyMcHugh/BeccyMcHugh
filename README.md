### Hi there ğŸ‘‹ 

ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to become a data analyst. I have been a maths teacher for 11 years and I am starting a career change. I am a mum to my two beautiful girls, my husband is a programmer and we have two cheeky cats that run around our feet all day! I am excited to start learning again through CFG.
